The field of MEMS sits right at the intersection between several engineering branches, and with the evergrowing list of tools available for modeling and data analysis, the number of concepts that you need to master can get long really fast.

I decided to launch this website as a pet project. I wanted to store somewhere the knowledge I accumulated during my PhD, and hopefully to save a minute or two of research to anyone interested in the topic.

Best of luck with your learning!

% \f is defined as f(#1) using the macro
\f{x} = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
    \hat \f\xi\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
    \,d\xi
